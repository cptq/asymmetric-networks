## GNN experiments for linear mode connectivity with Asymmetric networks

See `scripts/` for scripts to reproduce the linear mode connectivity experiments in our paper.

`asym_nets.py` contains model code, `interp.py` contains linear interpolation code, and `main_arxiv.py` contains training and evaluation code.
