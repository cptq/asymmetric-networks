# Code for creating datasets of trained image classifiers

We use [FFCV](https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv) to quickly train image classifiers.

See `scripts/train_cifar.sh` for an example of how to train models using this code.

`grid_runs` contains the important code that can be used to train datasets of ResNets and W-Asym ResNets.
